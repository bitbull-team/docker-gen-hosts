# docker-gen-hosts

Based upon Jason Wilder's docker-gen, this script maintain up-to-date your hosts file with all the docker containers' IP address.
If an env variable DOMAIN_NAME is available for a container, it will be used as an additional name. It's even possible to add multiple names, DOMAIN_NAME being a slash(/)-separated list of domain names.
